# About me! à¸…^â€¢ï»Œâ€¢^à¸…
Hello! Names you can call me are Nine, Spawn or whatever else you like / come up with a silly nickname for me!! I don't really mind which pronouns you use for me, but I prefer he/they.

Please do not copy any of my skins. If you want to take inspiration from one then that's fine but please ask me beforehand if I'm fine with it. As long as the skin you want to take inspo from is NOT one of my own OC's and not very heavy inspo, then I am most likely to be fine with it!!

I may or may not be active on Pony Town, but I usually am ..

Fandoms I'm into just because: Murder Drones, PokÃ©mon, Sonic, Forsaken, Warrior Cats, Regretevator, Let Him Go, Hazbin Hotel, Animal Jam, and maybe Dandy's World - I don't really play it anymore.
Also I kin quite a lot of characters so yay

I love cats, I know there's no reason for you to know this but I LOVE CATS. THEY'RE SO SILLY AND CUTE AND RAHH!!!

Anyway if you wanna be my friend, feel free to! But just so you know, I am overly sensitive, so think a little bit over what you say to me, but most of the time I wouldn't really mind (Loud [INCORRECT] buzzer). And so sorry if you ever notice I sound rude, I'm probably just having a bad day or something. 

BYEE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜¼
