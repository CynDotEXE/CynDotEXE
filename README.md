# About me
Hello! My name's Meow, you can call me Nine, Spawn or whatever else you like / come up with a silly nickname for me!! I don't really mind which pronouns you use for me, but I prefer he/they.

Please do not copy any of my skins. If you want to take inspiration from one then that's fine but please ask me beforehand if I'm fine with it. As long as the skin you want to take inspo from is NOT one of my own OC's and not very heavy inspo, then I am most likely to be fine with it!!

I'm not super active on Pony Town anymore but I can come on once in a while. I love to make new friends on there too!
I'm into a couple fandoms, I'll name them: Dandy's World, Poppy Playtime, Sonic the Hedgehog, PokÃ©mon, Super Cat Tales, Murder Drones, Indigo Park, Warrior Cats, Vocaloid, Forsaken, Let Him Go and that's about it!
Besides the fact I'm into quite alo of fandoms, I also fictkin some characters! Though I'm not sure of every single one and it could still change, I'll name them anyway: Dandy and Shelly from Dandy's World, Shadow from STH and Nine from Sonic Prime, CatNap, Scourge (Warrior Cats) and Ravenpaw, and J and Cyn from Murder Drones. 


I love cats, I know there's no reason for you to know this but I LOVE CATS. THEY'RE SO SILLY AND CUTE AND RAHH!!!

Anyway if you wanna be my friend, feel free to! But just so you know, I am overly sensitive, so think a little bit over what you say to me, but most of the time I wouldn't really mind (Loud [INCORRECT] buzzer). And so sorry if you ever notice I sound rude, I'm probably just having a bad day or something. 

BYEE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜¼
