# About me
Hello! My name's Meow but you can call me Nine, or whatever else you like / come up with a silly nickname for me!! I don't really mind which pronouns you use for me, but I prefer he/they.

I'm not super active on Pony Town anymore but I can come on once in a while. I love to make new friends on there too!
I'm into a couple fandoms, I'll name them: Dandy's World, Poppy Playtime, Sonic the Hedgehog, PokÃ©mon, Super Cat Tales, Murder Drones, Indigo Park, Warrior Cats, Vocaloid and that's about it!
Besides the fact I'm into quite alo of fandoms, I also fictkin some characters! Though I'm not sure of every single one and it could still change, I'll name them anyway: Dandy and Shelly from Dandy's World, Shadow from STH and Nine from Sonic Prime, CatNap, Scourge and Ravenpaw, and J and Cyn from Murder Drones.

I love cats, I know there's no reason for you to know this but I LOVE CATS. THEY'RE SO SILLY AND CUTE AND RAHH!!!

Anyway if you wanna be my friend, feel free to! But just so you know, I am overly sensitive, so think a little bit over what you say to me, but most of the time I wouldn't really mind (Loud [INCORRECT] buzzer). And so sorry if you ever notice I sound rude, I'm probably just having a bad day or something. 

BYEE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜¼
